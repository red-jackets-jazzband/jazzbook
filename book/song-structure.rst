Song Structure
==============

In traditional New Orleans jazz, the song structure can vary greatly from one piece to the next. However, it is common for these songs to have a relatively
simple structure, often consisting of just a chorus.

When a traditional New Orleans jazz song is played on the street, it is usually performed by a small group of musicians, such as a brass band or a jazz combo.
The lead instrument, such as the trumpet or saxophone, will often play a melody over a simple chord progression, while the other musicians provide a rhythm
section to keep the beat.

The chorus of the song is typically the most memorable and catchy part, and it is often repeated several times throughout the performance.
The chorus may include a memorable melody or refrain, and it is often where the main message or theme of the song is emphasized.

Between each chorus, the musicians may take turns improvising solos or engaging in group improvisation. These solos and improvisations
allow the musicians to showcase their skills and add their own unique flair to the performance.

Overall, traditional New Orleans jazz songs played on the street are characterized by their catchy melodies, improvisation, and energetic performances.

The simple structure typically is:

* Intro
* Collective chorus with clear statement of the melody by the lead
* Another collective chorus with a more loose interpretation
* Several solo's (sometimes interleaved by a chorus)
* One or more collective choruses
* An ending/outro

Intro
-----

The intro of a traditional New Orleans jazz song is typically a short, upbeat musical introduction that sets the stage for the rest of the piece.
It may include a musical introduction played by the band, a four-bar or eight-bar intro, a vamp, or a count-in.
BUt the most traditional intro for brassband music is the Roll-off.

Short intro
```````````
The intro may feature a short, upbeat melody played by the lead instrument, such as the trumpet or saxophone.
This melody may be repeated a few times before the rest of the song begins.

A four-bar or eight-bar intro
`````````````````````````````
In traditional New Orleans jazz, it is common for the intro to consist of a four-bar or eight-bar musical phrase played by the band.
This phrase may include a simple chord progression and a rhythm played by the percussion and rhythm instruments, such as the drums and piano.

Vamp
````
A vamp is a repeating musical phrase played by the band while the vocalist or soloist prepares to begin the song. The vamp may consist of a simple chord
progression and rhythm played by the band, and it may be repeated several times before the main body of the song begins.

Count-in
````````
In some cases, the intro may begin with a count-in by the drummer or bandleader, in which they give a signal for the rest of the band to start playing.
This count-in may consist of a few short drum beats or a spoken count.

Collective chorus
-----------------

The collective chorus establishes the memorable melody typically played by the trumpet.
The other front line instruments play countermelodies.

Solo's
------

In a New Orleans jazz performance, a solo is a section of the song where one or more musicians are given the opportunity to improvise and showcase their musical skills.
During a solo, the musician(s) playing the solo will typically play over the chord progression of the song, improvising melodies and phrasing
to create a unique, expressive performance.

The solos are often played by the lead instrument, such as the trumpet or saxophone. These instruments typically play the melody
and improvise solos during the chorus of the song. However, solos can also be played by other instruments, such as the piano or guitar.

During a solo, the rest of the band typically continues to play a steady pulse or groove to support the soloist. The other musicians may also play
countermelodies or harmonies to add depth and complexity to the music. See the section Comping for more details.

Solos are an important part of a New Orleans jazz performance, as they allow the musicians to showcase their skills and add their own unique flair
to the music. Solos can be short or long, depending on the song and the style of the performance. Some solos may be highly structured and planned out
in advance, while others may be completely spontaneous and improvised on the spot.

Ending/outro
------------

In a New Orleans street parade band, the trumpet is often used to signal the end of a song. As the lead instrument in the brass section,
the trumpet has a prominent role in the band's sound and is often used to convey important musical cues to the rest of the musicians.
When it's time to end a song, the trumpet player will often play a series of short, sharp notes or a distinctive melody to signal the end
of the song to the rest of the band. This helps to keep the music flowing smoothly and ensures that everyone is on the same page as the
band moves from one song to the next.

There are several types of endings that the trumpet can play to signal the end of a song in a New Orleans street parade band.
One common type of ending is the "hit," which involves the trumpet player playing a series of short, sharp notes to signal the end of the song.
This can be an effective way to bring the music to a dramatic close and create a sense of energy and excitement. Another type of ending that
the trumpet may use is a cadence, which is a specific melody or chord progression that is played to signal the end of the song. Cadences
are often used to give the music a sense of structure and form, and they can be very effective at creating a sense of resolution at the end of a song.

Eric Kelso describes several endings in the below video:

Straight out
````````````
Straight out ending is ending in the last bar of the regular progression, optionally with a hold. as Eric describes a hold should be done by multiple players.

Double ending
`````````````
Also known as King Oliver ending. This is adding two additional bars of the Tonic (I) chord or combination of the Tonic (I) and the Dominant (V).
This can be signalled by double stomping on the floor by the lead.

Turnaround ending
`````````````````
Also known as *Sweet Mama* Ending, This adds four bars with respectivly the `VI - ii - V - I`

Drum ending
```````````
Add four bars of drum solo and end with another 4 bars typically using the `ii - V - I - I`
