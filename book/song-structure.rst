Song Structure
==============

In traditional New Orleans jazz, the song structure can vary greatly from one piece to the next. However, it is common for these songs to have a relatively
simple structure, often consisting of just a chorus.

When a traditional New Orleans jazz song is played on the street, it is usually performed by a small group of musicians, such as a brass band or a jazz combo.
The lead instrument, such as the trumpet or saxophone, will often play a melody over a simple chord progression, while the other musicians provide a rhythm
section to keep the beat.

The chorus of the song is typically the most memorable and catchy part, and it is often repeated several times throughout the performance.
The chorus may include a memorable melody or refrain, and it is often where the main message or theme of the song is emphasized.

Between each chorus, the musicians may take turns improvising solos or engaging in group improvisation. These solos and improvisations
allow the musicians to showcase their skills and add their own unique flair to the performance.

Overall, traditional New Orleans jazz songs played on the street are characterized by their catchy melodies, improvisation, and energetic performances.

The simple structure typically is:

* Intro
* Collective chorus with clear statement of the melody by the lead
* Another collective chorus with a more loose interpretation
* Several solo's
* One or more collective choruses
* An ending/outro

Intro
-----

A typical intro of a traditional New Orleans jazz song may include the following elements:

- A short musical introduction played by the band: The intro may feature a short, upbeat melody played by the lead instrument, such as the trumpet or saxophone.
  This melody may be repeated a few times before the rest of the song begins.
- A four-bar or eight-bar intro: In traditional New Orleans jazz, it is common for the intro to consist of a four-bar or eight-bar musical phrase played by the band.
  This phrase may include a simple chord progression and a rhythm played by the percussion and rhythm instruments, such as the drums and piano.
- A vamp: A vamp is a repeating musical phrase played by the band while the vocalist or soloist prepares to begin the song. The vamp may consist of a simple chord
  progression and rhythm played by the band, and it may be repeated several times before the main body of the song begins.
- A count-in: In some cases, the intro may begin with a count-in by the drummer or bandleader, in which they give a signal for the rest of the band to start playing.
  This count-in may consist of a few short drum beats or a spoken count.

Overall, the intro of a traditional New Orleans jazz song is typically a short, upbeat musical introduction that sets the stage for the rest of the piece. It may include a musical introduction played by the band, a four-bar or eight-bar intro, a vamp, or a count-in.

Collective chorus
-----------------

The collective chorus establishes the memorable melody typically played by the trumpet.
The other front line instruments play countermelodies.

Solo's
------

In a New Orleans jazz performance, a solo is a section of the song where one or more musicians are given the opportunity to improvise and showcase their musical skills.
During a solo, the musician(s) playing the solo will typically play over the chord progression of the song, improvising melodies and phrasing
to create a unique, expressive performance.

In traditional New Orleans jazz, solos are often played by the lead instrument, such as the trumpet or saxophone. These instruments typically play the melody
and improvise solos during the chorus of the song. However, solos can also be played by other instruments, such as the piano or guitar.

During a solo, the rest of the band typically continues to play a steady pulse or groove to support the soloist. The other musicians may also play
countermelodies or harmonies to add depth and complexity to the music.

Solos are an important part of a New Orleans jazz performance, as they allow the musicians to showcase their skills and add their own unique flair
to the music. Solos can be short or long, depending on the song and the style of the performance. Some solos may be highly structured and planned out
in advance, while others may be completely spontaneous and improvised on the spot.
