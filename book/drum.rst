Rhytmic feel
~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Between the cracks feel" is a term that is often used to describe a specific style of groove or feel in New Orleans jazz.
This style is characterized by a loose, relaxed feel that is somewhere between a straight, four-beat feel and a swinging,
triplet-based feel. It is often described as falling "between the cracks" of these two traditional jazz feels.

In a New Orleans jazz performance, the between the cracks feel is typically created by the rhythm section, which includes
the drums, bass, and piano. The drummer may play a groove that combines elements of a straight four-beat feel with a more
syncopated, triplet-based feel, while the bass and piano provide a foundation for the rhythm.

The between the cracks feel is often associated with traditional New Orleans jazz and the blues, and it is known for its
laid-back, groovy feel. It can be found in a variety of jazz and blues styles, including brass band music, swing, and bebop.

The shimmy beat is a rhythmic pattern that was popularized by New Orleans drummer Baby Dodds, who was a key figure in the early jazz tradition.
The shimmy beat is characterized by a driving pulse on the bass drum, and a syncopated snare drum pattern played on the backbeats
(the second and fourth beats of the measure). The shimmy beat is often played at a fast tempo, and is characterized by a strong, energetic feel.

Baby Dodds was known for his powerful and dynamic drumming style, and his contributions to the jazz tradition have had a lasting impact on the music.
The shimmy beat is just one of many rhythmic patterns that Dodds played, and he is widely recognized as an important pioneer in the development of jazz drumming.
