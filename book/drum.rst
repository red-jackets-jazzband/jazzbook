Rhytmic feel
~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Between the cracks feel" is a term that is often used to describe a specific style of groove or feel in New Orleans jazz.
This style is characterized by a loose, relaxed feel that is somewhere between a straight, four-beat feel and a swinging,
triplet-based feel. It is often described as falling "between the cracks" of these two traditional jazz feels.

In a New Orleans jazz performance, the between the cracks feel is typically created by the rhythm section, which includes
the drums, bass, and piano. The drummer may play a groove that combines elements of a straight four-beat feel with a more
syncopated, triplet-based feel, while the bass and piano provide a foundation for the rhythm.

The between the cracks feel is often associated with traditional New Orleans jazz and the blues, and it is known for its
laid-back, groovy feel. It can be found in a variety of jazz and blues styles, including brass band music, swing, and bebop.
