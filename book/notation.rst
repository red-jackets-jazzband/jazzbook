Lead sheets
-----------

A *lead sheet* is a simplified version of a piece of music that typically includes the melody, lyrics (if applicable),
and chord changes. Lead sheets are commonly used in jazz music to provide a basic outline of a tune that can be used as
a starting point for improvisation.

Lead sheets usually include the melody of the tune written in standard music notation, as well as the lyrics (if applicable)
written out below the staff. The chord changes for the tune are also written out using chord symbols, which indicate the type
and quality of the chords used in the tune.

Lead sheets are typically used as a reference for musicians who are familiar with the tune, and provide a basic structure that
can be used as a foundation for improvisation. Musicians can use the lead sheet as a guide to play the melody and chord changes
of the tune, and can then add their own personal touch and style to the music through improvisation. Lead sheets are a useful
tool for musicians to communicate and play music together, and are an important part of the jazz tradition.

For our band we've created leadsheets for the songs we play at https://www.redjackets.nl/songs/.

The Jazz Default
----------------

As mentioned in the post *Jazz Notation- The Default* [DEB2014]_ , there are some assumptions when reading jazz music.

* Swing eight notes (but not fully, should be "between the cracks")
* Quarter notes are short
* Eight notes are long
* Fast notes will be slurred
* Long notes will swell
* If the dynamic is forte or more, the notes will be played with accents
* The length of the lead trumpet note is proportional to its height.
