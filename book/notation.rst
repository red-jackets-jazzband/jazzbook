Leadsheets
----------

A single sheet containing the chord structure and the main melody.
Not a perfect representation, but a tool for learning a song.

For our band we've created leadsheets for the songs we play at https://www.redjackets.nl/songs/.

The Jazz Default
----------------

As mentioned in the post *Jazz Notation- The Default* [DEB2014]_ , there are some assumptions when reading jazz music.

* Swing eight notes (but not fully, should be "between the cracks")
* Quarter notes are short
* Eight notes are long
* Fast notes will be slurred
* Long notes will swell
* If the dynamic is forte or more, the notes will be played with accents
* The length of the lead trumpet note is proportional to its height.
